            <p class="history-text" id="introduction-text">Coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia, where a goat herder
                named Kaldi noticed his goats became energetic after eating coffee berries. By the 15th century,<br>it spread to Yemen and the Arab world,
                becoming popular in Sufi religious practices and public coffee houses. In the 1600s, it reached
                Europe, where it<br>was initially controversial but quickly gained popularity. European powers then spread
                coffee cultivation globally — to Java, the Caribbean, and Brazil,<br>which became the top producer. In the U.S.,
                coffee became especially popular after the Boston Tea Party. Today, supported by organizations like
                the<br>National Coffee Association (founded in 1911), coffee is a global drink with growing focus on specialty quality, sustainability, and ethical sourcing.

                Rise of Coffee Plantation in Asia.

                <p class="history-text" id="origins-text">
                    The rise of coffee began in ancient Ethiopia with its discovery by a goat herder named Kaldi, and
                    quickly spread across the Arab world, where it became central to<br>religious and social life. By the
                    15th century, coffee was being cultivated in Yemen and served in public coffee houses, becoming a
                    vital part of Islamic culture.<br>In the 17th century, coffee entered Europe and grew in popularity,
                    despite initial resistance. Coffee houses became centers of intellectual exchange and commerce.<br>As global demand soared, colonial powers spread coffee cultivation to Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
                    In the United States, coffee gained patriotic significance<br>after the Boston Tea Party and became
                    a national favorite. Over time, coffee evolved from a simple drink into a global industry, symbolizing
                    energy, conversation,<br>and culture — with modern trends focusing on specialty brews, fair trade,
                    and sustainability.

                <p class="history-text" id="origins-text">
                    The rise of coffee in Asia began in the 17th century through trade and colonial influence. Initially
                    introduced by
                    European colonizers and traders, coffee cultivation<br>spread to countries like India, Indonesia,and
                    Sri Lanka. Over
                    time, local farmers adopted coffee farming, especially in highland regions. In recent
                    decades,<br>Asian countries like
                    Vietnam (now one of the world’s top coffee producers), Thailand, and China have developed strong
                    coffee cultures and
                    industries,<br>blending traditional tastes with global trends, making Asia a major player in both
                    coffee production and
                    consumption today.

                <p class="history-text" id="introduction-text">
                    In the New World, especially in colonial America, coffee began replacing tea after the Boston Tea
                    Party in 1773,
                    when American colonists protested British taxation<br>by dumping tea into Boston Harbor. This event
                    sparked a patriotic
                    shift—drinking coffee became a symbol of American independence and resistance against<br>British
                    rule. As a result,
                    many Americans turned to coffee as their preferred beverage. Over time, coffee grew in popularity,
                    supported by
                    increased imports<br>from the Caribbean and Latin America, eventually becoming the dominant drink in
                    the United States
                    and across much of the New World.
